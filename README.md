# SW2StuffingGeneratorComponent
Hello! I proudly present the StuffingGeneratorComponent, designed to fill 
up OSU components that may be hard or annoying to very easily!

So far, the the components that the component can translate to each other would be
* NaturalNumber
* Sequence
* BinaryTree

It works best when the Type inside the <> is a String because that would allow
generateSimple to work everytime.

If not, I would reccomend using generate complex instead

Adding on to the component is pretty easy as all you have to do is figure out how to
translate the output component into a sequence and that's kind of it.

If I were to improve on this, I would make it so that for the clients, it would
be even easier to use, and that more datatypes inside the <> are supported

Thanks for taking you time to learn about my component!
